PATCH NOTES â€” AImaster unified sink (applied to your files)

Changed files:
- include/io_sink.h (NEW)
- src/serial_handler.h (UPDATED if missing externs)
- src/serial_handler.cpp (INSERTED init message and included io_sink.h)
- src/main.cpp (INCLUDED io_sink.h; replaced prompt prints with emit_prompt(); converted banner prints to outln())

Build steps:
1) Copy include/io_sink.h into your project's include/ path.
2) Replace your files with the ones in src/ as appropriate, or merge diffs.
3) make clean && make

What changed exactly:
- Added unified sink functions: out(), outln(), emit_prompt().
- serial_handler.cpp: after successful init (serial_available = true), we add:
      outln("AImaster: Serial link active");
      emit_prompt();
- main.cpp: any `std::cout << "-> "` style prompt prints were replaced with `emit_prompt();`
  and startup banners use outln().

If you want streaming callback changes (ollama_client.cpp), let me know or provide your current file and I'll merge it similarly.
